# Summary

`ml4gw` is a lightweight, PyTorch-based library designed to accelerate the development and deployment of machine learning (ML) models on gravitational-wave (GW) timeseries data. Built to provide familiar functionality to anyone used to working with CPU-based GW libraries, `ml4gw` lowers the barrier to entry for GW researchers who want to incorporate ML into their work and take advantage of accelerated hardware. The library was originally developed with a focus on utilities for GW detection, but has a modular and extensible structure that enables it to support other areas of research. Ultimately, the aim is to provide a common set of tools for scientists in the field and reduce duplication of efforts.
